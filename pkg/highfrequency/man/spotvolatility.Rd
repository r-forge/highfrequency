\title{Spot volatility estimation}
\description{
The \code{spotvolatility} package offers several methods to estimate spot
volatility and its intraday seasonality, using high-frequency data.
}
\details{
The following spot volatility estimation methods have been implemented:
}
\section{Deterministic periodicity}{

The spot volatility is decomposed into a a deterministic periodic factor
f_{i} (identical for every day in the sample) and a daily factor s_{t}
(identical for all observations within a day). Both components are then
estimated separately. For more details, see Taylor and Xu (1997) and
Andersen and Bollerslev (1997). The jump robust versions by Boudt et al.
(2011) have also been implemented.
}

\section{Stochastic periodicity}{

This method by Beltratti and Morana (2001) assumes the periodicity factor to
be stochastic. The spot volatility estimation is split into four components:
a random walk, an autoregressive process, a stochastic cyclical process and
a deterministic cyclical process. The model is estimated using a
quasi-maximum likelihood method based on the Kalman Filter. The package
\code{\link[=fkf]{FKF}} is used to apply the Kalman filter.
}

\section{Nonparametric filtering}{

This method by Kristensen (2010) filters the spot volatility in a
nonparametric way by applying kernel weights to the standard realized
volatility estimator. Different kernels and bandwidths can be used to focus
on specific characteristics of the volatility process.
}

\section{Piecewise constant volatility}{

Another nonparametric method is that of Fried (2012), which assumes the
volatility to be piecewise constant over local windows. Robust two-sample
tests are applied to detect changes in variability between subsequent
windows. The spot volatility can then be estimated by evaluating
regular realized volatility estimators within each local window.
}

\section{GARCH models with intraday seasonality}{

The package also includes an option to apply GARCH models, implemented by
the \code{\link{rugarch}} package, to estimate spot volatility from intraday
data. This is done by including external regressors in the model. These
regressors are based on a flexible Fourier form, which was also used in the
stochastic and deterministic periodicity estimation methods.
